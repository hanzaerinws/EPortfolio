  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p>
    This year has helped me gain a deeper understanding of information technology, both in theory and in practice. I learned important skills such as programming, database management, networking, and basic cybersecurity. Through these lessons, I realized that the IT field is wide, fast-changing, and full of opportunities. Each topic showed me how technology plays an important role in solving real-world problems.

I also developed stronger problem-solving and critical-thinking skills. Many projects challenged me to think logically, fix errors, and find better solutions. Working with classmates taught me the value of teamwork, communication, and patience. These experiences showed me that success is easier to achieve when people work together toward a shared goal.

This journey also helped me grow personally. I became more disciplined, responsible, and focused in managing my time and meeting deadlines. Most importantly, I learned to trust God throughout my academic journey. In times of difficulty and pressure, I relied on Him for strength, wisdom, and guidance. I now understand that learning is a continuous process, and with faith in God, every challenge becomes an opportunity to grow.

As a 2nd-year BSIT student, I am more confident in my skills and more motivated to continue improving myself. I look forward to the coming years with hope, faith, and determination, knowing that God is guiding my path.
